# CV
USER PROFILE: 

"My name is Javier Ruiz and I am a Quality Assurance (QA) Coordinator at a mid-sized video game development studio. My primary role in hiring is to hire people with strong work ethic and communication skills for testing and support roles. My goal is not only to review technical skills, but also to identify candidates who demonstrate the ability to handle the pressure and discipline required for the production cycle. 

I highly value the skills gained in environments such as retail and hospitality: accountability, inventory management, attention to detail and conflict resolution. I understand that these skills are highly transferable to QA and studio support.
In my opinion, a web resume is a sign that a candidate is proactive, adventurous and actively learning the technical basics. I especially appreciate that the Experience section is structured so that I can see these soft skills and work engagement at a glance."


INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE:

The architecture of this Curriculum Vitae I have designed to favor a quick reading, responding to the needs of the end user (Javier Ruiz, coordinator of QA). My goal with this restlessness is that the one who reads my CV can read and extract everything necessary quickly, without any kind of distraction.
My project is structured in a single page format, that is, the user who is reading it does not need to click, only swipe down and find everything. The only click that the user can find is in the header, where with a click you can instantly go to the section of interest.
My structure is divided into six sections, including the header where the photo, the name and the interaction bar are located, the other five are the following:
- About: Where my skills, good things and bad things are presented, where instead of starting with a summary of all the skills, I focus on softer skills such as discipline and work ethics, which are key filtering criteria for the user.
- Languages: It is just after About, in this section I set the levels with the languages that are, but I bet on a more visual way quickly replacing the typical descriptive text. Communication is very important in international support.
- Experience: I have implemented a timeline format, showing not only the chronology but also the durations of these works.The textual content explains apart from the roles I had in the works, the skills I obtained with these such as section management, customer service under pressure, versatility, etc.
- Education: I quickly explain my time at different institutions, either in school, in high school, obtaining ESO, later my time at the same high school and finally in the Degree in Video Games at the University of Girona.
- Contacts: This section is the final section, the footer, clearly grouping my contact channels, giving the user more ease to contact me


VISUAL DESIGN:

The visual design of my Curriculum Vitae has been made in a minimalist but at the same time functional way, making its priority easy readability and that it has a direct impact. I have also projected professionalism, without distractions, so that what I read my CV is effectively the key information.

The color palette I have used is based on three colors, primary red (#BF3535), used in header, dividing lines, interactive elements, titles, etc. For the background I used white (#ffffffff) and a light gray (#e5e5e5 /#f9f9f9), between these two colors I was changing the background thus creating a visual rhythm.

Finally, a dark gray color (#333 / #444) is used for the main text, which ensures excellent readability and meets accessibility standards. In terms of typography and style, a sans-serif font (such as Roboto) is used in different weights (400 for body text, bold for headings) to create a clear typographic hierarchy. The headings are red, larger and have a red subrrtllat.

I have made a complete structure, that is, that the red bars occupy 100% of the width, also the content I have limited it to a maximum width of 1100px and is centered. The featured profile image is absolutely positioned, overlaying the red bar, creating a dynamic visual anchor point.
